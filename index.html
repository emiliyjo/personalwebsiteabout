              To briefly talk about the history of coffee and capitalism, coffee was one of the first commodities to be traded in large scale. Talking about Europe in specific, it was not until 1650s that coffee gained some popularity in markets, as a result of Dutch traders who dominated world trade in 17th century (105,). Growing coffee trades allowed Dutch traders to increase their coffee growths to more of their colonies by brutally enslaving native population. As coffee became more affordable in markets, coffeehouses sprung up throughout Europeans countries including Italy, Britain, France, Holland, and Scandinavia. (105) Now talking about the consumption, the new industrial working class became the basis for a new mass consumer market in cheap everyday goods.
